Education
======
* M.Sc. Candidate, Plant Physiology, ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, New Delhi, India, 2020
  * Thesis title: **High-throughput phenotyping of rice genotypes for nitrogen use efficiency**.
  * Rice materials: 300 diverse rice genotypes (3k IRRI, BAM, national cultivars, etc).
  * Objectives: This aim of this study were to identify donors for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice using high throughput phenomics approach and to map QTLs/genes governing NUE in rice genotypes. 
  * University: ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Nanaji Deshmukh Plant Phenomics Centre.
  * Location: Pusa campus, New Delhi, India.
  * Duration: 2018-2020.
* B.Sc. Advanced Crop Science, Vietnam National University of Agriculture, GiaLam, Hanoi, Vietnam, 2015
  * Thesis title: **Photosynthetic characteristics of some newly developed short growth duration rice lines (*Oryza Sativa L.*)**.
  * Rice materials: Four newly rice lines containing genes *GN1 (grain number 1)*, which increase number of grains per panicle (D31, D32) and *WFP1 (wealthy farmer’s panicle 1)*, which increase number of primary branches in panicle (D35, D36). These lines were developed from genetic background of Khang Dan 18 (KD18) by backcrossing method and MAS (Marker Assisted Selection).
  * Objectives: Examine the agro-physiological characteristics such as: photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, dry matter weight, crop growth rate, leaf area, leaf size related to the grain yield.
  * University: Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Plant Production Physiology Laboratory
  * Location: Trauquy, Gialam, Hanoi, Vietnam
  * Duration: 2014-2015
