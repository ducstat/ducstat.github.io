Hello! My name is NGUYEN TRUNG DUC (DUC), MSc scholar in Plant Physiology Division at ICAR- Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India. After completed my undergraduate in 2015, I worked as researcher, in charge of vegetable and flower research at the Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Trauquy - Gialam - Hanoi - Vietnam. Last year (November 12th, 2018), I received an ICCR scholarship that came to India to study Master in Agricultural Science, Plant Physiology.
My research here at Nanaji Deshmukh Plant Phenomics Centre, ICAR- IARI is focused on consolidating multiple omics data to understand and improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice. My research aims to combine genomics and phenomics approaches to investigate how rice responds to low nitrogen consumption and to provide mechanisms to enhance their response.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Master Research
======
Thesis title: HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING OF RICE GENOTYPES FOR NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY
Rice materials: 300 diverse rice genotypes (3k IRRI, BAM, national cultivars, etc)
Objective: This aim of this study were to identify donors for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice using high throughput phenomics approach and to map QTLs/genes governing NUE in rice genotypes. 

BSc. Research
======
Thesis title: Photosynthetic characteristics of some newly developed short growth duration rice lines (Oryza Sativa L.)”
Rice materials: Four newly rice lines containing genes GN1 (grain number 1), which increase number of grains per panicle (D31, D32) and WFP1 (wealthy farmer’s panicle 1), which increase number of primary branches in panicle (D35, D36). These lines were developed from genetic background of Khang Dan 18 (KD18) by backcrossing method and MAS (Marker Assisted Selection).
Objectives: Examine the agro-physiological characteristics such as: photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, dry matter weight, crop growth rate, leaf area, leaf size related to the grain yield
