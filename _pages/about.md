Hello! My name is NGUYEN TRUNG DUC (DUC), MSc scholar in Plant Physiology Division at ICAR- Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India. After completed my undergraduate in 2015, I worked as researcher, in charge of vegetable and flower research at the Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Trauquy - Gialam - Hanoi - Vietnam. Last year (November 12th, 2018), I received an ICCR scholarship that came to India to study Master in Agricultural Science, Plant Physiology.
My research here at Nanaji Deshmukh Plant Phenomics Centre, ICAR- IARI is focused on consolidating multiple omics data to understand and improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice. My research aims to combine genomics and phenomics approaches to investigate how rice responds to low nitrogen consumption and to provide mechanisms to enhance their response.

Research Interests
======
My research aims to integrate phenomic and genomics approaches to understand how plants respond to environmental stresses, and to provide breeders with a means to improve these responses. My overarching goal is to bridge plant physiology and quantitative genetics to provide a mechanistic understanding of how plant respond to various abiotic stress conditions and provide the novel methods to phenotyping faster, highly accuracy, save time and man power.

Research Duties
======
1. Breeding F1 maize,
2. Conducting experiments on lily, tulip, watermelon,muskmelon, tomato.
3. Support students doing experiments for undergraduate and postgraduate research.

Master Research
======
Thesis title: HIGH-THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING OF RICE GENOTYPES FOR NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY
Rice materials: 300 diverse rice genotypes (3k IRRI, BAM, national cultivars, etc)
Objective: This aim of this study were to identify donors for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice using high throughput phenomics approach and to map QTLs/genes governing NUE in rice genotypes. 

BSc. Research
======
Thesis title: Photosynthetic characteristics of some newly developed short growth duration rice lines (Oryza Sativa L.)”
Rice materials: Four newly rice lines containing genes GN1 (grain number 1), which increase number of grains per panicle (D31, D32) and WFP1 (wealthy farmer’s panicle 1), which increase number of primary branches in panicle (D35, D36). These lines were developed from genetic background of Khang Dan 18 (KD18) by backcrossing method and MAS (Marker Assisted Selection).
Objectives: Examine the agro-physiological characteristics such as: photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, dry matter weight, crop growth rate, leaf area, leaf size related to the grain yield
